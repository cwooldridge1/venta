# Venta
 A light weight signal based JavaScript library and framework for building web applications.

 Get started now with
```bash
npx create-venta-app@latest
```
See [npm create-venta-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-venta-app) for more info on getting started.

### Disclaimer
This framework is not polished and should not be used for production applications. I am currently no longer working on this project and it is more of a proof of concept. I hope to eventually come back and polish off this repo.
